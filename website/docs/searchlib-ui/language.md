# Language features

Searchlib React uses a typical setup of React + Babel + Webpack. If you're
developing a React application powered by EEA Searchlib, you should integrate
it in your pipeline.

For LESS integration you should use the `@eeacms/search-less` package together
with semantic-ui-less. See the demo package.
